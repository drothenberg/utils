utils
=====

A set of utilities for manipulating content written in the OVAL Language. These are general utilities that will assist anyone in using OVAL content.

Several utils were configured into NetBeans projects for those wishing to build from source although binaries will be also be provided. XSL Transforms will require a compatible program such as the oXygen XML Editor or a XSLT transforming library such as Xalan.
